# Sklearn-Pipeline-Demonstration---Iris-Dataset-Analysis
## Introduction
Most machine learning models require us to perform several data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, PCA etc. before actually training the model on the data. This leads to a writing a lot of code lines that when written sequentially look messy and the overall approach is not the best in terms readability.
<br />
<br />
Machine learning pipelines can be very handy in this case as they enable a user to write and organize cleaner looking code and help with the ease of understanding. Also, when new data is introduced, the pipeline automatically performs all the necessary pre processing steps before training the model on the new data for further prediction - thereby iterating and automating all the processing steps
<br />
<br />
We will be using the iris flower dataset from the sklearn library in order to demonstrate a machine learning pipeline in this notebook and predict the species of the flower
